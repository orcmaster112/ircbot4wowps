#lamers is a better place for you
A pity you have to leave so early
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
And now eat my poo-poo
Boo-hoo
Come back when you've finally learned not to be lame
Cya later - much later
Enough for today rookie
Everybody be cool, YOU - be cool
Get lost
Go play leapfrog with a unicorn
I didn't invite you, did I?
I love pressing this button
I rather want you to stay at teletubbies.com
I wonder what this button does?
Insufficient maturity detected
It's not that I hate you, it's just... that I don't like you

Ladies and Gentlemen - may I present: King Op
Lame and fake - that's you
Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!
My channel, my rules
No Homers
Nope - no wrong button
Oops, I did it again
Perhaps you should try real life for a while
Pimp your brain
Pissing me off is one of your skills
See you in hell
Sometimes there is no other solution
Sorry, but you are dismissed
Testing... Worked.
Thank you, drive through
Thanks for your visit
The op is always right
This is not #kiddiechat

Waste your time wherever you want, but not here
Yes, I have ops
You didn't understand any of this
You really wanted it, right?
You're falling in a bottomless pit of loneliness
You're not welcome here
You've been dying since the day you were born
